        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 mt-4">
          <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>

          <li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
          <li>
            Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of

        <p className="mt-4">
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,

          </li>
          <li>
            The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to
            such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain
            Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an

          Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the
          Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.

          Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can
          object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User
          objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such
          purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer
