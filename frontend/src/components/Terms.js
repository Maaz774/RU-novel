        <strong>7. SERVICE FEES</strong>
      </p>
      <ol className="roman-list ml-8 mt-2">
        <li>
          Royal Road offers parts of its Services free of charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Royal Road also offers fee-based plans for readers and authors. You may use them subject to purchasing one of the Service’s plans, as listed in Royal Road’s website at: <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/premium/subscription" className="text-blue-500">https://www.royalroad.com/premium/subscription</a>. From time to time, we may change the Services fees, upon reasonable prior notice that we will post on the Services or send you by email.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may pay the fees by using the methods of payments as available, published and updated from time to time on the Services. We currently use PayPal as a third-party payment provider to process payments. PayPal is a third-party service provided by PayPal Holdings, Inc. and is subject to the PayPal User Agreement. If you are located in Israel, the relevant PayPal User Agreement can be found <a href="https://www.paypal.com/il/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full" className="text-blue-500">here</a>; if you are located in the UK, the relevant PayPal User Agreement can be found <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full" className="text-blue-500">here</a>; if you are located in the USA, the relevant PayPal User Agreement can be found <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full" className="text-blue-500">here</a>, and if you are located elsewhere in the world the relevant PayPal User Agreement for such country or region will apply to your relationship with PayPal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you use the App, you may also pay the fees via such payment method as stated in the App from time to time (for example the Google Play Store payment processor), in which case the fees may be converted into the currency used in your country. Fees will be regarded as paid only after your payment has been confirmed. The relevant features of the Services will be available to you promptly after you have paid the Service fees. You acknowledge that fees are not refundable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payments will be required to include applicable taxes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Royal Road will use its reasonable commercial efforts to have a transaction processed accurately and expeditiously and reimburse you for any excess payment mistakenly charged. However, Royal Road will not be liable for mistakes, errors, malfunctions and miscalculations made by you, the payment service providers, or other third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon failure to make any payment or other material breach of these Terms, Royal Road may remove, disable or terminate the “Premium” feature of your Account. You waive any and all claims against Royal Road and anyone on Royal Road’s behalf in connection therewith.

          <strong>Support of Authors</strong>. Readers that are Account holders may support authors with regular or ad-hoc contributions. For the processing of such contributions we work with Tebex, a third party service provided by Tebex Limited. Tebex will apply their terms as may be enforceable by them from time to time to the processing of such payments. Authors may add a link to their Tebex account on their fiction page to give other users the option to support their work. As an author, you may decide to grant such supporters the right to advanced access to chapters published on the Services, or other rewards as deemed appropriate.

          <strong>Release.</strong> When you use the Services, you release Royal Road from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — that arise out of or are in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

Our total liability to you for all claims arising from or related to your use of the Services or any content will be limited to the amount paid by you for access to the Services in the past twelve months.
